# Learning objectives

1. Explain principles that determine the **absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of medications.**
2. Discuss how medications administered for their clinical use act on their target(s) to produce both beneficial **pharmacological actions and adverse drug reactions.**
3. Demonstrate how the **mechanisms of actions and clinical use of medications** affect the **cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, respiratory and nervous systems** when administered to patients.

# Learning objectives (cont.)

4. Demonstrate the mechanisms of actions and clinical use of **antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications,** guide therapeutic use when administered to patients.
5. Apply the principles that determine the **quality use of medicines** to patient therapy in healthcare including **complementary and alternative medicines.**

# Medication errors

![bg right w:590](figs/Med_error.jpeg)

Significant driver for medication-related harms

 - Medical error is the 3rd leading cause of death in the US (Makary et al., 2016)

# What is your role in medication safety?

![bg right w:600](figs/Med_cycle.jpeg)

* Administering
* Monitoring

# What is your role in medication safety?

![bg right w:600](figs/Med_cycle.jpeg)

- Administering
- Monitoring

> Do you have a role in prescribing and dispensing?

# Terminology

**Medication incident**
- Any problem that arises in prescribing, dispensing or administering a medicine. They do not need to cause harm.

**Medication error**
 - Any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use or patient harm
 - Can result in
   - Adverse event
   - Near miss where a patient is nearly harmed
   - Neither harm not potential for harm

# Terminology (cont.)

**Adverse Drug Event (ADEs)**
 - A medication incident that causes patient harm
   - Includes harm caused by medication errors and harm caused by an expected (but unfortunate) side effect of the medication
   - Classified in terms of severity, reversibility and preventability

# Relationship between medication errors and ADEs

# Models of care to address medication errors

# Case example: Daisy

15 year-old female admitted to hospital following seizure

**Treatment:** Levetiracetam infusion, midazolam, clonazepam

> Order was not written by current treating team

 - Order for clonazepam (not on imprest)

![bg right w:500](figs/Clonazepam.jpeg)

# Case example: Daisy

* Two treating nurses were unfamiliar with the appropriate dose for clonazepam interpreted the prescription:
  * `Clonazepam 2.5mg` (instead of 0.5mg)
  * Administered 5x 0.5mg tablets
* Patient transferred to ICU overnight for monitoring

![bg right w:500](figs/Clonazepam.jpeg)

# Case example: Deborah

55 year old male post cardiothoracic surgery

Registrar instructed by consultant to chart `bisoprolol`.

Registrar unfamiliar with this medicine (usually used metoprolol) charts `bisoprolol 12.5mg`

* Nurse administers `bisoprolol 12.5mg`
* Patient outcome: bradycardia - needs temporary pacing

![bg right w:600](figs/bisoprolol.jpeg)

# How would you classify these?

a. Medication incident
b. Medication error
c. A near miss
d. An Adverse Drug Event

![bg right w:500](figs/UQPoll_QR.jpeg)

# A pharmacist example

![](figs/Barca.jpeg)

# Where do these errors occur?

> A midwife is about to administer a prescribed dose of 600mg of benzylpenicillin for prevention of Group B streptococcal disease. The order is for 600mg every 4 hours until birth. The midwife checks the protocol and realises the recommended dose is 1.8 grams every 4 hours until birth. The midwife contacts the prescriber and the medication order is changed.

# Approaches to medication safety

 - Standardised medication charts
 - IV safety software (live/labels)
 - The 5/6 rights
 - Involve the patient/consumer

# Frequent sources of medication errors

 - Incorrect strength of medication given when multiple are stocked
 - Immediate release vs. slow release
 - Medication patches
 - Similar names

# Know, check, ask

**Know** what you are giving and where to go if you don't (AMH, MIMs, ward pharmacist)

**Check** requirements for legal prescription

**Ask** the patient (and involve them)

# National and state-level standards

 - 5 rights
 - 6 rights - Right to...:
   - Patient
   - Drug
   - Dose
   - Route
   - Time
   - Refuse
 - Hospital-specific guidelines
